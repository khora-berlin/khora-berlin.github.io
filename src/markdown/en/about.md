# About Us

## Who are we?


Well first, we’re a group of passionate bike enthusiasts who love to support, engage with, and explore the communities around us. We were all tired of the monopolistic, hierarchical structure typical businesses are run by and figured we could do better.

Khora is a collective. We have no single owner, no CEO, no managers, no directors.

We’re an autonomous group where everyone has a say and can influence the internal structure/ideas. No angel investors, no quotas, no agenda to fulfill.


Rather, we’re built from the ground up in a way that benefits us and the community around us. A very hands-on approach, we’re focused on working in a way we’d like to see the world shaped.

## Why us?

Similar services are near-predatory in their practices; egregious profits from restaurants, poor customer support, and lack of care to the workers on the ground.

We’re 100% transparent with pricing to restaurants and the customer, and are a tightly-knit group who would rather empower our local sphere rather than purely capitalize on it.

By supporting us, you in turn support the greater picture by how we work with local restaurants and the society around us.

We value ethics, moral values, and changing a system which has turned sour.

## About the group

Coming from all walks of life, we support one another and have developed a small community amongst ourselves.

We all have our own personal side-projects, passions, hobbies, and adventures which we work on - just like you.

We’re trying to navigate this ‘business’ world as thoroughly and consciously as we can, being a drip in the bucket of positive change. That’s why Khora was formed.
