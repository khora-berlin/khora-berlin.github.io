We were all tired of the monopolistic, hierarchical structure typical businesses are run by and figured we could do better.</p>\n<p>Khora is a collective. We have no single owner, no CEO, no managers, no directors.</p>\n<p>We’re an autonomous group where everyone has a say and can influence the internal structure/ideas. No angel investors, no quotas, no agenda to fulfill.</p>\n<p>Rather, we’re built from the ground up in a way that benefits us and the community around us. A very hands-on approach, we’re focused on working in a way we’d like to see the world shaped.</p>\n<h2>Why us?</h2>\n<p>Similar services are near-predatory in their practices; egregious profits from restaurants, poor customer support, and lack of care to the workers on the ground.</p>\n<p>We’re 100% transparent with pricing to restaurants and the customer, and are a tightly-knit group who would rather empower our local sphere rather than purely capitalize on it.</p>\n<p>By supporting us, you in turn support the greater picture by how we work with local restaurants and the society around us.</p>\n<p>We value ethics, moral values, and changing a system which has turned sour.</p>\n<h2>About the group</h2>\n<p>Coming from all walks of life, we support one another and have developed a small community amongst ourselves.</p>\n<p>We all have our own personal side-projects, passions, hobbies, and adventures which we work on - just like you.</p>\n<p>We’re trying to navigate this ‘business’ world as thoroughly and consciously as we can, being a drip in the bucket of positive change. That’s why Khora was formed.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"about","videoSourceURL":null,"videoTitle":null}},{"html":"<p>We’re a group of passionate bike enthusiasts who love to support, engage with, and explore the communities around us.
